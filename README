-----
-add ability for server to load definition files (all non-graphics related assets)
-server move character around
-server have state of character
-on connect send to client
-client take input
-client use input to move character around
-client send input to server
-server take client input and update state
-server broadcast to clients the state
-implement physics for player movement
  -client physics predict
  -server physics
  -server client update
  -client get update and roll forward

-character walk to mouse, click to swipe, right click to pickup (default interact)
-other Object
-character collide with Object
-Give player and object some stats
-load map
-character collide with map
-monster
-monster follow and attack character
-map auto generator
-monster, thing spawner

Questions/thoughts
-----
physics, game actions
Will have to be done on the server side in something like Pomelo.
Keyboard actions can start movement of the action locally and send it to the server
But results of any actions have to come from server
So physics needs to be implemented server side
Most basic way to start is for player input be sent to server and all actions
are pushed from server to client.

multi player with no cheating:
server has to calc collision and other actions
server has to generate map
keep track of all states, send states to players

how to keep population of single planet managable for server?
-first just do a hard limit
-later maybe naturally limitted by food, shelter, guards and keep people out
-disease, starvation, etc.

How To
------
Make sprites:
ShoeBox for extracting sprites
TexturePacker for creating atlas (sprite file and json)
Then need to define a animations file and things file (both json)

For dynamic map generation:
http://www.html5gamedevs.com/topic/2727-dynamic-tilemap-generation/

game.load.tilemap('level', null, generateLevel(), Phaser.Tilemap.CSV );

And generateLevel returns a CSV string looking like this:

"0,0,0,0,0\n1,1,0,0,1\n1,12,0,15,1\n"

Ideas:
-Start out as single player RPG survival
-Wake up in the woods
-Can make your own way in forest
-Or find a village, town, city
-Fight monsters etc to gain items and XP
-Level up, learn crafting
-Can change world with right tools
-Can hire or attract followers that you can control, RTS style
-Can build with enough resources
-If you mess with other peopleâ€™s buildings and are spotted, town guards (which could be controlled by other players) can find you and kill or capture you
-If captured get taken to jail or dungeon
-Money / items / XP possibly taken - followers might abandon you

starting
-Start with basic set of things
-You start in your own area, nothing can visit that area until it reaches the
size of a village. (so if you keep it small you can hang there risk free forever)
-Or you can leave and journey away to another "planet" once you find the portal
-It's risky to go to a town before you are well enough equipped etc
-Traders will randomly come through your area at some point and you can trade
natural resources for items.
-You can also explore and fight monsters etc to find items

Morality
-If you attack another player first you get a black mark of some sort
-But once a player attacks you, you can attack back
-Your symbol or name on your followers, gain black mark if they do same

Citizen Ship
-You can gain citizenship to another player or guild etc
-Leaders (Mayors, kings, queens) can declare war against others
-If a player kills a citizen the lord can declare war against that citizen
-Citizens are free to attack anyone who is a citizen of a leader you are at war with

Towns
-build walls, and a gate, charge tax to new citizens
-Charge a property tax
-Charge a commerce tax
-Build structures - mills, barracks, keep, library, etc - civ
-Build siege weapons etc
-Can build class training centers (armory, mage school, cleric school, thief guild, etc)

-Doing certain actions will call the town guards, and get you taken to prison

Principalities
-Receive share of taxes in return for military support and protection
-Kill town mayors that don't give the tax.

High Level Characters
-Can hack there way into a castle and kill the lord, become the lord or just free the cities
-Go on quests

Social
-Let players customize their avatar, maybe buildings
-Maybe badges over avatars, maybe avatars themselves
